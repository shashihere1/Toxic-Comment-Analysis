Introduction 
In the following sections, a brief introduction and the problem statement for the work has been included.
1.1	Introduction
Social media platforms have grown to be important forums for public conversation in the current digital era, allowing people to exchange opinions and engage in discussions on a worldwide level. The open format of these sites has, however, also contributed to the spread of offensive and toxic remarks, which may be harmful to both people and communities. It is now imperative to solve this problem in order to preserve respectful and healthy online communities. The objective of this research project is to create a machine learning-based system that can identify and categorize harmful tweets or comments, helping to mitigate the harmful effects of online toxicity.

This project is necessary in order to improve the internet user experience by removing hazardous content. Robust mechanisms are necessary for social media platforms and online communities to automatically detect and handle harmful comments, allowing users to participate in civil and productive dialogues. The main objective is to develop a classifier that can reliably identify between comments that are harmful and those that are not, thereby offering a tool for analysis and moderation.

1.2	Problem Statement
"Develop a dependable and effective machine learning model capable of classifying comments and tweets into categories of toxicity- toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate, by using a Bi-LTSM model" is the project's problem statement. This entails overcoming a number of obstacles, including managing the complex and varied nature of language, resolving imbalances in datasets, and guaranteeing the model's scalability and suitability for use across a range of online platforms.

1.3 Technologies Used
To achieve the objectives of this project, a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning are employed. The key technologies and tools used include:
 
Figure 1.1 NLP
1.	Python: The primary programming language used for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
2.	Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis, enabling efficient handling of large datasets and numerical computations.
3.	Matplotlib: For visualizing data distributions and model performance metrics.
4.	TensorFlow and Keras: The deep learning framework and its high-level API, respectively, were used for building, training, and evaluating the neural network model.
This combination of technologies provides a comprehensive framework for building and deploying a toxic comment classifier, leveraging the strengths of both traditional NLP methods and deep learning techniques. The implementation details and evaluation results are discussed in the subsequent sections of this paper, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed solution in addressing the issue of online toxicity.



Chapter 2
Literature Survey
In this chapter some of the major existing work in these areas has been reviewed.
[1] An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was shown to significantly increase classification over a baseline Naïve Bayes solution in a particular investigation. Remarkably, the LSTM's True Positive Rate exceeded the Naïve Bayes method's by about 20%.
The following are recommended avenues for future research:
Enhancing NLP Classifier Performance: Investigation into Alternative Algorithms: Examine the effectiveness of algorithms like CNN and Support Vector Clustering (SVC).
Extension to Multi-Label Classification: In line with the general objective of the Kaggle competition, which encompasses seven kinds of comments, extend the present binary classification task to the multi-label classification challenge.
How Support Vector Machines (SVM) Are Used: For text processing and classification, use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and integrate a grid search for hyper-parameter optimization.
Implementation of Additional Deep Neural Network (DNN) Methods:
recently published papers such as [10] have shown that CNN proves to have a very high performance for various NLP tasks.

This work demonstrates how sophisticated machine learning techniques can enhance categorization performance and paves the way for more investigation of various NLP algorithms and approaches.
[2] The paper introduces various deep learning approaches applied to the task of classifying toxicity in online comments. The study examines the impact of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) methods, in combination with word and character-level embeddings, on identifying toxicity in text. The approaches were evaluated on Wikipedia comments from the Kaggle Toxic Comments Classification Challenge dataset. The word-level assessment revealed that the forward LSTM model achieved the highest performance in both binary classification (toxic vs. non-toxic) and multi-label classification (classifying specific kinds of toxicity) tasks. For character-level classification, the best results were obtained using a CNN model. However, overall, the word-level models significantly outperformed the character-level models. Future work aims to achieve higher performance by applying richer word and character representations and utilizing more complex deep learning models.
[3] This paper proposed a Machine Learning Approach combined with Natural Language Processing for toxicity detection and its type identification in user comments. Finally, the Mean Validation Accuracy, so obtained, is 98.08% which is by far the highest ever numeric accuracy reached by any Comment Toxicity Detection Model. The research done in this paper is intended to enhance fair online talk and views sharing in social media. A more robust model can be developed by applying Grid Search Algorithm on the same dataset over the Machine Learning Algorithms for every pipeline, being used in order to obtain more better results and accurate classifications.

Monolingual toxic text detection: Prior investigations into the identification of monolingual toxicity have been conducted in detail. The majority of research is conducted with English corpuses[4][5][6], however studies in Hindi, Korean, Russian, and Spanish are also conducted[7][8][9]. For example, the dataset toxic comment classification challenge [https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge] is made up of six different classes (toxic, severe-toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity-hate), and the dataset created for insulting/abusive language detection has three classes (sexist, neutral, and racist)[11]. The task can be expressed as a binary[7][10] or multiclass[11][12] classification problem.

Multilingual toxic text detection: Because of the language barrier, the monolingual detection approach is inapplicable to other languages[13]. Various studies employ several ways to address the issue of the language barrier. Translating multiple languages text into single language text and extracting the semantic features from the text is one method for dealing with multilingual text[14]. The problem with this strategy is that text in several languages after translation generates noise in data and reduces data quality, which is a drawback of this technique. In this study, the author used an English language corpus to train a model, which was subsequently translated into other languages for categorization purposes[15]. The authors of this paper employ text label propagation to perform text categorization using bilingual characteristics into machine translation[16]..Compared to the classification model, which only examines monolingual texts, this strategy improves the F1 value in each class.

Methodology 
3.1 Data Description
This research focuses on automatically classifying social media comments as toxic or non-toxic using various machine learning models. The models are trained and tested on binary-class datasets. This project categorizes toxic comments into multiple subcategories like toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate.
The original Kaggle dataset includes multi-label classifications like severe toxic, obscene, and threat. Non-toxic comments remain in their own class, while only comments explicitly labelled as toxic are selected from the remaining categories.
3.2 Pre-processing 
Data pre-processing enhances machine learning model efficiency. The following steps were implemented:
•	Tokenization: Breaks text into smaller units (tokens) like words or numbers, retaining essential information while maintaining security.
•	Stemming: Reduces words to their root form (e.g., "plays," "playing," and "played" become "play"), increasing performance by eliminating variations.
3.3 Feature Engineering
Traditional approaches like one-hot encoding and bag-of-words models represent words as sparse vectors with limited semantic information. This project leverages word2vec to generate dense word embeddings, capturing intricate word relationships and enabling the model to understand the context and meaning of comments with greater nuance.
3.4 Model Development
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks are highly effective for analyzing sequence data, making them ideal for identifying toxic comments. Unlike traditional RNNs, Bi-LSTMs scan text in both directions, capturing word relationships and sentiment shifts. When combined with word embedding techniques like word2vec, Bi-LSTMs transform words into rich vectors, enhancing the model's ability to understand intent and distinguish between playful banter and toxic slurs.

3.5 Utilizing NLP and Machine Learning Tools
The project employs advanced NLP techniques and various machine-learning tools to build, train, and deploy the model. Key steps include:
•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: Implementing NLP techniques such as stop-word removal, lemmatization, and normalization to prepare the dataset.
•	Model Training: Using machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras to train the Bi-LSTM model on the prepared dataset.
•	Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness in detecting toxic comments.
